     <!--
     <P> Dr. John Snow's map of dots from 1855 mapping the «London Cholera Epidemic (1854)» is one of the first maps with epidemic data (each dot represents a cholera dead) in relation to the local water pump: «Snow observed that cholera occurred almost entirely among those who lived near (and drank from) the Broad Street water pump. He had the handle of the contaminated pump removed, ending the neighborhood epidemic which had taken more than 500 lives.</p>
